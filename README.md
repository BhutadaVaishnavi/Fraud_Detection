# Fraud_Detection
This dataset, generated using the PaySim simulator(PaySim is a simulator designed to create synthetic datasets that replicate real-world mobile money transactions), replicates real-world mobile money transactions while embedding fraud patterns for research purposes. It includes transaction types like CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, PAYMENT, and TRANSFER over 30 simulated days. Scaled down to 25% of its original size to ensure privacy, this dataset is ideal for fraud detection studies.
Using this data, I developed a fraud detection model to accurately identify fraudulent transactions with minimal false negatives, reducing financial and reputational risks for organizations. To handle the class imbalance, I applied SMOTE (oversampling the minority class) and utilized Random Forest with class_weight and XGBoost tuned for imbalanced data. The model achieved a recall of 0.88, ensuring most fraudulent activities were detected, though with some trade-offs in precision.
This solution has wide-ranging applications across industries, including banking, e-commerce, insurance, healthcare, and government taxation, delivering robust fraud prevention capabilities.
